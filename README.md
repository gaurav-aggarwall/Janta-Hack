# Janta Hack

We are thankful to Analytics Vidhya for organising this Machine Learning Competition, during the lockdown period due to COVID-19.  

We are grateful to all the CoronaFighters that are serving our nation in such tough times. Our deepest regards to them and their families.


[Janta_Hack](./Janta_Hack.ipynb) summarises our submission for the hackathon and [final_sub.csv](./final_sub.csv) is the final submission CSV. Our approaches have been briefly described in the notebook.   

Apart from the described techniques, we did explore other options as well such as 
- Automated Machine Learning
- Feed Forward Neural Networks

Though, not they did not perform that well, we would be sharing there implementations as well. 

*Please Note:*  Plotly figures are not rendered in GitHub's online view, so EDA section in the notebook might seem incomplete. Here, are some images though,
